Guidelines to fall back on for critique and discussion:

1. **Describe** what you're experiencing
2. **Analyze** its construction and parts
3. **Translate** into impressions, emotions, ideas
4. **Evaluate** its effectiveness (on its own terms)

It takes time to get to know any work well, but this can at least give us a good start!

Review
------


Let's look at some code and try to figure out what it will look like:

<div class="code-columns">

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Bashō</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" type="text/css">
</head>

<body>

<pre>
Gladly will I sell
For profit,
   dear merchants of the town,
My hat laden with snow
</pre>

<p>—
  <a href="https://tinyurl.com/jpe7lp8">
    Matsuo Bashō
  <a>
</p>

</body>
</html>
```

```css
body {
  background-color: snow;
  color: lightsteelblue;
  
  font-family: "Helvetica";
  font-size: 35px;
  
  padding: 20%;
}

pre {
  font-family: "Georgia";
  font-size: 150%;
  margin: 0;
}

p {
  text-align: right;
}

a {
  color: lightslategray;
  text-decoration: none;
}

```

</div>

What will this look like? [Let's see](/examples/basho/)

Basic typo styles
------------------

A quick introduction to some CSS typography styles:

---

### [`font-family`](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp)

```css
font-family: "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
```

`font-family` sets your typeface, and allows you to set some backup options. In the example above, the browser will:

1. First try `Helvetica`,
2. if that doesn't work then `Arial`,
3. otherwise use the default `sans-serif` font for the system.

---

### [`font-size`](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp)

[![The EM square](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/images/baseline.png)](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/The_EM_Square.html)

We can use a variety of differnt sizing units for type size. Each of these settings will set the size of the typeface's [EM square](http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/The_EM_Square.html).

**Note:** all of these units work on other size-related css rules like `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, etc.

#### pixels

```css
font-size: 50px;
```
This one's pretty easy — `px` just uses a pixel value to set the EM square size.

#### percentages

```css
div { font-size: 16px; }
p { font-size: 50%; }
```

```html
<div>
  <p>This type will be 8px</p>
</div>
```

The percentage unit is less obvious — the `%` value is relative to the `font-size` of the parent container.

So in the above example the `p` font size is `50%` of the `div` font size, which comes out at `8px`.

#### ems

```css
body { font-size: 10px; }
p { font-size: 1.4em; } /* =14px */
```

This is similar to the the percentage units, but initially the `em` size is relative to `body` element's font-size (rather than the parant container).

There are some gotchas here -- mainly, the `em` size compounts gets multiplied in nested elements. [More info here](https://css-tricks.com/why-ems/).

#### rems

```css
html { font-size: 10px; }
/* p size = 14px no matter where it is! */
p { font-size: 1.4rem; }
```

A recent solution to the issues with `em` is `rem`, or [root em](https://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem). Basically, this is similar to `em` but _always_ relative to the `<html>` Element.

#### viewport units

```css
font-size: 50vh;
font-size: 50vw;
font-size: 50vmin;
```

Finally, [viewport units](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/)! These are my favorite, and I used them excessively on this class site :).

Basically viewport units are relative to the size of your browser window, on a range of `0-100` (so basically percentage points). 

* `vw` is relative to the browser width
* `vh` is relative to the browser height
* `vmin` is relative to the smallest of the two

---

### [`line-height`](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_line-height.asp)

```css
line-height: 1.2em;
```

`line-height` is essentially the web version of we call [leading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading) in the rest of the typography world.

---

### [`letter-spacing`](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_letter-spacing.asp)

Simarily, `letter-spacing` = [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning).

---

### Google fonts!

[![Google Fonts](/assets/02/googlefonts.png)](https://fonts.google.com/)

Web fonts used to suck, and we had to pick from a tiny list of options available on most computers. Not anymore! And Google has provided us with a _huge_ collection of nice fonts to use in our projects. [How to use Google fonts](http://cssreset.com/how-to-use-google-fonts/)

CSS Selectors
--------------

We already know that we can use the name of HTML tags to style elements in CSS. For instance, this will make the background of the `<body>` element yellow:

```css
body { background: yellow; }
```

We can also use [_classes_](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_class.asp) and [_ids_](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.asp).

There's really only one difference between the two: _an `id` should only be used once on a page, but a `class` can be used as many times as you want_. For example:

<div class="code-columns">

```html
<h1 id="header">Oh, hai</h1>

<h1>sup</h1>

<p class="line">Gladly will I sell</p>
<p class="line">For profit,dear merchants of the town,</p>
<p class="line">My hat laden with snow</p>
```

```css
#header {
  color: blue;
}
.line {
  color: red;
}
```

</div>

In this example, only the first `<h1>` element with the id of `header` will be colored blue, but all of the `<p>` elements with the `line` class will be colored red.

The box model &amp; color
===============================

Joseph Albers was an amazing artist &amp; educator, [you can read more about him here](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/16/interaction-of-color-josef-albers-50th-anniversary/). Let's use one of his paintings, _Homage to the Square: Soft Spoken_, as a learning tool:

The Box Model
-------------

No, _not_ this:
![Box Model?](/assets/02/box-model1.gif)

This:
![Box Model](/assets/02/box-model2.png)

## What is it?

The box model is one of the most elemental concepts used in HTML/CSS development. It's made of the following parts (via [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)):

* **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear
* **Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
* **Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content
* **Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

## The clock metaphor

You'll often see box model styles with the following shorthand:

```css
margin: 12px 3px 6px 9px;
```

The best way to remember how this works is to think of a clock -- the first value is the top (12:00), the second is the right (3:00), the third is the bottom (6:00) and the last is the left (9:00).

## Learn more

You can learn a bunch more about the box model at [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) and [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/), but maybe the best way to learn about the box model is to play around with it in Chrome Web Tools.



Color
------

What's the smallest element of a digital on-screen image?

![Subpixel 1](/assets/02/subpixel1.jpg)

![Subpixel 2](/assets/02/subpixel2.jpg)

![Subpixel 3](/assets/02/subpixel3.jpg)

You probably said "pixel." Nope, introducing [subpixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering).

There are [many ways](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors_legal.asp) of representing color in CSS:

```css
background-color: yellow;
```
Using [named colors](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/named-colors-and-hex-equivalents/).

```css
background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);
```
Using RGB (red, green, blue) values (each is a value 0-255).

```css
background-color: #ffff00;
```
This pretty much the same as `rgb` but using [hexidecimal notation](http://www.codeconquest.com/hex-color-codes/) as a shorthand.

```css
background-color: hsl(60%, 100%, 50%);
```
While most of the time color is represented in RGB values, we can also do [HSL (hue, saturation, brightness)](http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp) representation (note that unlike RGB, `hsl` uses percentages).

```css
background-color: rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5);
```
Finally we can include opacity, or `alpha` as it's commonly called in the computer graphics world.

There are many other color references on the web, [this one](http://sixrevisions.com/css/colors-webdesign/) does a pretty good job of summing it up.
