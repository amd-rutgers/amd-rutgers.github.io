# JavaScript (revisited)

## Basics

First thing to remember: statements in JavaScript are like sentances — you have to end them! In JS instead of using periods (`.`) we use semicolons (`;`).

without punctuation the computer does not know how to read your code we are the same way a book without punctuation would be virtually unreadable or at the very least really annoying

Also, in the same way that we can still kind of read text without punctuation, you can get away with leaving out semicolons much of the time. But it's better to get in the habit because this will trip you up eventually! 

### Comments & Debugging

First let's start with a few things that are mainly built for us humans.

Comments help us add annotations to our code (you'll see these used in examples below).

```js
// a single-line comment

/*
a multi-
line comment
*/
```

The JavaScript console makes it easy to check what's going on with our code by printing it out. It's sort of like a stethoscope for our code.

```js
console.log("Do as I say, JavaScript");
console.log("(this is mainly to help us humans)");
```

### Variables

We use these to store information -- they're one of the basic building blocks of code. Think of variables as buckets we can fill with whatever we like. We use the `var` keyword to create a variable. 

```js
// this "declares" a variable, makes our bucket
var bucket;

// this "assigns" our bucket, or fills it with something
bucket = "fun";

// we can dump it out & fill it with something else
bucket = "sun";

// we can also do this all in one step 
var barrel = "monkeys";

// now this wil print out "monkeys"
console.log(barrel);
```

There are specific rules about how variables are named. Here are some examples valid names:

```js
var lowercase;
var camelCase;
var under_scores_are_fine;
var numbersAreMostlyOk99;
```

These are no good:

```js
// ERROR
var no spaces;
// BANG!
var no-dashes-or-punctiation!;
// KABOOM!
var 7noStartingWithNumbers;
```

Variables have a **data type**, basically what kind of data it contains. Here are a few:

**Numbers** are pretty obvious:

```js
// a number can have a decimal just be a whole number
var bottlesOfBeer = 99;
var glass = 0.5;
```

**Strings** are text surrounded by quotes. They are a _string_ of letters, which are called "characters" in computer-speak:

```js
// you can use single or double qutes
var firstName = 'John';
var lastName = "Doe";

// you can use "+" to connect strings together
// this will print "John Doe"
console.log(firstName+" "+lastName);
```

**Arrays** are less intuitive, they're a collection of other variables that have a specific order. Think of an array as a bookshelf, where each book is in a specific order.

```js
// create an array with 3 strings
/// divided by commas, in square brackets
var books = ["The Great Gatsby", "Cloud Atlas", "Ulysses"];

// we can add another string at the end
books.push("The Design of Everyday Things");
```

We can access array items based on their number (or "index" in computer-speak):


```js
// IMPORTANT: array numbering starts at 0!
// this will print "The Great Gatsby"
console.log(books[0]);

// this will print "The Design of Everyday Thinks"
console.log(books[3]);

```

There are many other data types, but we'll save those for later.


### Functions

Functions are basically little code-machines. You set them up to do a specific task and they make life easier for you. 

```js

// this defines the function
function remindMe() {
  console.log("Don't forget to bring a towel!");
}

// will print "Don't forget to bring a towel"
remindMe();
```

A function can have what are called arguments, which are variables that you send into the function.

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hi, "+name+"!");
}

// will print out "Howdy, Al!"
greet("All");

// this prints out "Howdy, Pardner!"
greet("Pardner!");

```

There are a lot of functions that already exist that you'll find yourself using. For instance, `console.log` is a special function that will print out whatever you feed it to the console!


## Document object model

The Document Object Model is the system that allows JavaScript to connect to a web page.

### Page elements

There are several approaches to grabbing page elements so that we can manipulate them. The main methods are `document.getElementById`, `document.querySelector`, and `document.querySelectorAll`. 

In cases where we want to get just one element, `getElementById` or `querySelector` work fine.

```js

// this will find the page element with the id "home"
// example: `<div id="home"></div>`
var home = document.getElementById("home");

// this does the same thing, but it can use
// any CSS selector
var body = document.querySelector("#home");

// get the element on the page with class "main-header"
var header = document.querySelector('.main-header')

```

But what if we want to select multiple files? 

```js
// this will get all `<h1>` elements
// and save into an array
var headers = document.querySelectorAll('h1');

// now we can access each element individually

// this will print the first h1
console.log(headers[0]);

// this will print the second
console.log(headers[1]);

```


### Modifying page elemnts

Once we have an HTML element, we can do all sorts of things with it!

```js
var div = document.getElementById('home');

// change the contents of the element
div.innerHTML = "Hello!";

// add a class to the element
div.className = "my-class";

// change text color
div.style.color = "red";

```

### Creating page elements

We can use `document.createElement` to create page elements.

```js

// create an h1 element
var header = document.createElement('h1');
header.innerHTML = "Hey there!";

// add to the body
document.body.appendChild(header);
```

## Basic interaction

We can do some basic interaction with JavaScript.

Basic dialog windows.

```js
// open a dialog window
alert("Yo!");
```

Basic input

```js
// we can also use a dialog to
// collect a yes/no answer
var answer = confirm("Are you sure?");
console.log(answer);
```
Respond to events like `click`

```js
// we can also listen for events and respond to them
document.body.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert("Can't touch this!");
})
```

## jQuery?

What is jQuery? It's a few things.

1. A "wrapper" to make certain js functions (like `querySelector`) easier to use and more compatible for multiple browsers
2. A swiss-army knife that adds functionality to js
3. A plugin system that makes it easier to add functionality to your page.

Let's write something in vanilla JavaScript:

```js
var body = document.querySelector('body');

// create greeting div
var message = document.createElement('div');
message.class = 'greeting';
message.innerHTML = "Hello there!";

// add event listener
message.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert("How are you?");
});

// add greeting div to page
body.appendChild(message);

```

Now let's see what it looks like using jQuery

```js
// this will do the same thing!
// but it looks like jibberish at first

// create greeting div
var $greeting = $('<div class="greeting"></div>');

// add event listener
$greeting.on('click', function() { alert("How are you?")});

// add greeting div to page
$greeting.appendTo($('body'));
```

# Advanced CSS

## Transforms

[_CSS Transforms_](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transform/)  are a way to turn your flat, blocky CSS page elements into easier-to-manipulate objects. Think of it as a way to turn a Microsoft Word Document into an Adobe Illustrator document.

Some basic things you can do with CSS tranforms:

* `translate` (move)
* `rotate` 
* `skew`
* `scale` (resize)
* `matrix` (all of the above)

You can transform objects as 2D or 3D elements.

```css

/* Move over 10px to the right and 10px down */
img {
  transform: translate(10px, 10px);
}

/* Rotate 180 degrees in 2d */
.rotate {
  transform: rotate(180deg);
}

/* Rotate 90 degrees in 3d */
.rotate3d {
  transform: rotateY(90deg);
}

/* 150% scale */
.big {
  transform: scale(1.5);
}

/* mix-n-match */

h1 {
  transform: translate(10px, 10px) rotateY(90deg) scale(1.5);
}

```


## Transitions

[CSS Transitions](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) allow you to animate between different states within your css stylesheet. It's a very simple example of keyframing.

In the example below, the `.secret` div will fade in when the `.revealed` class is added.

```html
<div class="secret">Hidden text here!</div>
```

```css
.secret {
  padding: 2em;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 2s;
}

.secret.revealed {
  opacity: 1;
}

```

You can also transition multiple properties at once:

```css
.accordian {
  height: 0;
  opacity: 0;
}

/*
 * this will fade in and grow vertically
 */
.accordian.show {
  height: 50px;
  opacity: 1;
  transition: height 1s, opacity 2s;
}
```



## Animation

[CSS Animation](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/) is kind of like Transitions+. It allows you to have more control over keyframing animation, create looping animations, etc.

To set up an animation you first create a named keyframe sequence:

```css
/*
 * This will simply rotate 360 degrees
 */
@keyframes rotate {
    to { transform: rotateY(360deg); }
}
```

Then you add it to a style:

```css
#image {
  /*
    this is the name of the `@keyframes` definition
    we want to use
  */
  animation-name: rotate;

  /* how long the animation lasts */
  animation-duration: 6s;

  /* you can set easing fuctions here for natural movement */
  animation-timing-function: linear;

  /* how many times will it run (in this case, forever) */
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```

As you can see, there are many properties you can adjust to tune your animiation. What's great about animations is you can set multiple "steps" throughout the animation to have finer control:

```css
@keyframes pulse {
  /*
   * this ensures that the background is
   * yellow at the beginning and end of the loop
   */
  0%, 100% {
    background-color: yellow;
  }

  /*
   * but the background should be red halfway through
   */
  50% {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

## Media Queries

[_CSS Media queries_](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) allow you to change styles based on what screen your site is being viewed on.

In this example the background will change color based on screen size:

```css
/* 
 * Landscape phones and down
 */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    background-color: red;  
  }
}

/*
 * Landscape phone to portrait tablet
 */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  body {
    background-color: yellow;  
  }
}

/* 
 * Portrait tablet to landscape and desktop
 */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 979px) {
  body {
    background-color: green;  
  }  
}

/* 
 * Large desktop
*/
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  body {
    background-color: glue;  
  }  
}

```

# Exercise: The Big Button

Use the [provided template](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/big-button/archive/master.zip) to create an interactive composition. The composition should:

1. Have a button for the user to push
2. Begin animating when that button is pushed
3. Stop animating when the button is pushed again

## Examples

* [Example 1](https://amd-rutgers.github.io/big-button/example-01/)
* [Example 2](https://amd-rutgers.github.io/big-button/example-02/)
