Excercise
---------

Linked verse. 

Find the text of a poem online to style typographically. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Poetry_%28Bookshelf%29) is a good place to find poems in the public domain.

As a general reference for HTML/CSS terminology please refer to [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com/).

Try various typographic parameters listed [here](http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/typography).
As a text editor you can use [brackets](http://brackets.io/).

and finally you can use [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com/) for choosing and using fonts online.

_To be continued next week!_
