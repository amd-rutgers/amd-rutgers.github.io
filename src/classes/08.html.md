# What is data visualization?

![Boring bar chart](/assets/08/boring-bar-chart.jpg)

> There is no such thing as information overload. There is only bad design.

_Edward Tufte_

Data visualization is taking information from the real world and presenting it in a way that evokes a specific idea or story.

![Data Drawing](/assets/08/data_drawing.png)

Use data collected over the past week to make a drawing.

1. Create a processing sketch that loads in your data and creates an illustration using your data points
2. Import PDF from your sketch into Illustrator
3. Create a drawing / illustration using the imported sketch

You **must** procedurally generate part of your drawing from the data in processing, even if it seems like it might be easier to just do by hand.

[Download the starter project here](/assets/08/data_drawing.zip), or see it [on GitHub here](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/data_drawing).

# Assignment: data poster


Use a dataset to create an informational poster illustrating a concept or idea.

A few places to look for data:

* Government data
  * [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)
  * [data.NJ.gov](https://data.nj.gov/)
  * [data.ny.gov](https://data.ny.gov/)
* [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)
* [Words](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) (look in "data" folder, data is in JSON format)

# Next Class

**First**, choose a data set to use for your next project. Please **let me know your choice by this friday** so that I can review and have pointers for you by next class. A few starting points for public data:

* [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)
* [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)

**Second**, Bring printed work to class! You should have ready to show:

  1. Three prints of your album cover design (4.5in x 4.5in)
  2. One print of your data drawing exercise from class Monday (10in on shortest side)
