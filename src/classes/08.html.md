# What is data visualization?

![Boring bar chart](/assets/08/boring-bar-chart.jpg)

> There is no such thing as information overload. There is only bad design.

_Edward Tufte_

Data visualization is taking information from the real world and presenting it in a way that evokes a specific idea or story.

# If statements & other helpful tools



## Comparison operators

One of the most fundamental tools we have in programming is comparing two things to each other and determining if they are the same, or if one is bigger than the other. In Processing we do this with _comparison operators_, which will compare two values and result in either `true` or `false`.

We've already seen these in use in loops, take this `for` loop as an example:

```processing
for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
  println("Number "+i);
}
```

The second statement within the paranthesis (`i<10`) uses the _less than_ operator (`<`), and can be read as _`i` is less than ten. As long as that statement is `true`, the loop will continue. Once `i` is *not* less than ten, then it will equal `false` and the loop will stop.

We use the following operators in Processing:

* `==` (equal to)
* `!=` (not equal to)
* `<` (less than) 
* `>` (greater than)
* `<=` (less than or equal to)
* `>=` (greater than or equal to)


## `if`/`else`

Often we will work with statements, called _boolean expressions_ that end up equaling either `true` or `false`. Often it's use these types of statements to allow different outcomes in our code.

As an example, let's say we're making a game with a variable `lives` that keeps track of the number of lives a player has. The following if statement will output the number of lives only if there are more than zero:

```processing
if(lives > 0) {
  println("You have "+lives+" lives left");
}
```

For an `if` statement, whatever is in-between the parentheses should be a boolean expression that is either `true` or `false`. If it's `true`, than the code between the brackets is executed, otherwise the code between the brackets is ignored.

Now, sometimes you want more of an either/or situation. For example:

```processing
if(lives > 0) {
  println("You have "+lives+" lives left");
} else {
  prinln("GAME OVER!");
}
```

When the expression between the parentheses is `true`, the `if`/`else` works pretty much the same as the regular `if`. _But_ when `false`, the code between the first set of brackets is ignered, but the code between the second set of brackets (after the `else`) is run. It's either one or the other.

Finally, you can create more complex structures with `else if` statements:

```processing
if(lives == 1) {
  println("You're almost dead! One more life left.");
} else if (lives > 0) {
  println("You have "+lives+" lives left");  
} else {
  println("GAME OVER!");
}
```

Now there are 3 different outcomes: if `lives` is _exactly_ `1` than the first message is printed, if not then if `lives` is greater than `0` the second message is printed, and finally if none of those are true then it's `GAME OVER!`.

## `map` in Processing

# Exercise: data drawing

![Data Drawing](/assets/08/data_drawing.png)

Use data collected over the past week to make a drawing.

1. Create a processing sketch that loads in your data and creates an illustration using your data points
2. Import PDF from your sketch into Illustrator
3. Create a drawing / illustration using the imported sketch

You **must** procedurally generate part of your drawing from the data in processing, even if it seems like it might be easier to just do by hand.

# Next Class

![Data](/assets/08/big_data.gif)

**First**, choose a data set to use for your next project. Please **let me know your choice by this friday** so that I can review and have pointers for you by next class. A few starting points for public data:

* [Awesome Public Datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets)
* [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)

**Second**, Bring printed work to class! You should have ready to show:

  1. Three prints of your album cover design (4.5in x 4.5in)
  2. One print of your data drawing exercise from class Monday (10in on shortest side)
