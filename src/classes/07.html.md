# Today

We'll be learning to use p5.js's older sibling, [Processing](https://processing.org/).

Recreate this Judd aquatint using Processing + loops.

# Processing Examples

## Type / `random()`

![random_text](/assets/07/random_text.png)

[View code](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums/blob/master/examples/random_text/random_text.pde)

## Shapes / `noise()`

## Color / `randomGaussian()`

![color_gaussian](/assets/07/color_gaussian.png)

In [this example](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums/blob/master/examples/color_gaussian/color_gaussian.pde) we're using the `randomGaussian()` function and the `color()` function to randomly generate colors.

### Gaussian distribution

According to [the Processing documentation](https://processing.org/reference/randomGaussian_.html), the `randomGaussian()` function:

>> Returns a float from a random series of numbers having a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Each time the `randomGaussian()` function is called, it returns a number fitting a Gaussian, or normal, distribution. There is theoretically no minimum or maximum value that `randomGaussian()` might return. Rather, there is just a very low probability that values far from the mean will be returned; and a higher probability that numbers near the mean will be returned.

Another way of talking about gaussian or standard distribution this is with something more familiar from grading: a **bell curve**.

In the case of `randomGaussian()`, the left side of the curve is -1, the right is 1, and 0 is at the center. The "hump" shows that any value you get is more likely to be near the middle. 

### Color

In the past, we've seen colors in processing set by using the `fill()` and `stroke()` functions, passing numbers for the rgb values:

```processing
fill(255, 0, 0); // set fill to red
stroke(200); // set stroke to light grey
```

Rather than immediately set the color to a `fill` or `stroke` we can instead create a `color` variable that will store that color:

```processing
// set c1 to green
color c1 = color(0, 255, 0);

// draw a green square
fill(c1);
noStroke();
rect(10, 10, 100, 100);

// draw a green circle outline
stroke(c1);
noFill();
ellipse(50, 50, 15, 15);
```

Using the `color` function to set variables allows us to store and re-use colors.

### Gaussian colors

So, if we want to make a color that as somewhat random, but not _too_ random, we can use `randomGaussian()`:

```processing
color c1;
c1 = color(105, 210, randomGaussian()*30 + 231);
```

This will take whatever random number is generated by `randomGaussian()`, multiply it by 30, and add it to the default blue value of the color.
Here's a sample of what it will look like over 3 different tries:

<div style="height: 2em; background:rgb(106, 210, 245);"></div>

```
0.4851488 * 30 + 231 = 245.55446
```

<div style="height: 2em; background:rgb(106, 210, 257);"></div>

```
0.88432544 * 30 + 231 = 257.52975
```

<div style="height: 2em; background:rgb(106, 210, 201);"></div>

```
-0.9807428 * 30 + 231 = 201.57771
```

[Have a look at the source code for this example on GitHub](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums/blob/master/examples/color_gaussian/color_gaussian.pde) to see how `randomGaussian()` is used to set the color values.

# Project: Unknown Albums

![Unkown Pleasures](/assets/07/unknown_pleasures.jpg)

[Download project template here](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums)

Create album art for a fictional album using Processing. Using the randomization features in Processing, your album art should have at least **2 components that are different every time the album is generated**.

Your album cover should have:

1. An artist name
2. An album title
3. At least 1 graphical element

While Processing is capable of including images, I would recommend avoiding the use of images to preserve print quality.

Good luck!

1. Finish your [Unknown Albums](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums) project. We'll print a few versions and discuss next class. You can use the projects in the "examples" section of the template or look for more in [album examples](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/album-examples). 
2. For at least five days in a row, **pick one aspect of your life to track and record**.  Make sure you pick something that you can realistically collect data on, and be sure to document it well. See [_Dear Data_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28465052-dear-data) for inspiration!
