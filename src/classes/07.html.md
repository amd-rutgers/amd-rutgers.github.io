# Today

We'll be learning to use p5.js's older sibling, [Processing](https://processing.org/).

# Exercise: Donald Judd

Recreate this Judd aquatint using Processing + loops.

# Processing Examples

## Type / `random()`

![random_text](/assets/07/random_text.png)

[View code](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums/blob/master/examples/random_text/random_text.pde)

## Shapes / `noise()`

## Color / `randomGaussian()`

# Project: Unknown Albums

![Unkown Pleasures](/assets/07/unknown_pleasures.jpg)

[Download project template here](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums)

Create album art for a fictional album using Processing. Using the randomization features in Processing, your album art should have at least **2 components that are different every time the album is generated**.

Your album cover should have:

1. An artist name
2. An album title
3. At least 1 graphical element

While Processing is capable of including images, I would recommend avoiding the use of images to preserve print quality.

Good luck!

1. Finish your [Unknown Albums](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/unknown_albums) project. We'll print a few versions and discuss next class. You can use the projects in the "examples" section of the template or look for more in [album examples](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/album-examples). 
2. For at least five days in a row, **pick one aspect of your life to track and record**.  Make sure you pick something that you can realistically collect data on, and be sure to document it well. See [_Dear Data_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28465052-dear-data) for inspiration!
