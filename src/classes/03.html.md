## Schedule updates

1. +1 week to work on portfolios
2. Moving d3.js & SVG to the next unit
3. Next week we'll cover advanced CSS, including transitions and animation!

# Let's get organized!

[View example here](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/sample-work-folder) or [download .zip](https://github.com/amd-rutgers/sample-work-folder/archive/master.zip).

## Folder structure

It may seem silly at first, but having your own folder structure can really save you in the long run.

* Make a consistant set of rules for yourself
* Stick to this and hold yourself accountable
* Make it a point to clean up after each project

## Naming

Keeping consistant naming conventions is a good first step. Also, it's a good idea to **avoid using spaces** when working on web projects, as they cause trouble once you upload. 

Consistent naming conventions can also be helpful. Some popular options:

* `TitleCase`
* `camelCase`
* `snake_case`
* `kebab-case`

## Versioning

Having some kind of version system can save you from disaster in the heat of the moment. Keeping backups

* Using numbered naming system with files
* Using zip files for folders

There are more advanced versioning systems available -- you may have heard of git which is a very popular one.

## Goals

1. Figure out site architecture -- how many pages? How will navigation work?
2. Make a plan for how you'll tackle it
2. Start styling

## Deploying

There are many ways to deploy, ours may be the easiest. Think of the deploy step like sending a print project to press. 

1. Prepare
2. Backup (local, remote)
3. Test

# JavaScript crash course

Fire up those JavaScript Consoles! 

1. Open up Google Chrome and go to the class site
2. Hold down `option` + `command` and then hit `j`
3. Boom!


## Basics

First thing to remember: statements in JavaScript are like sentances — you have to end them! In JS instead of using periods (`.`) we use semicolons (`;`).

without punctuation the computer does not know how to read your code we are the same way a book without punctuation would be virtually unreadable or at the very least really annoying

Also, in the same way that we can still kind of read text without punctuation, you can get away with leaving out semicolons much of the time. But it's better to get in the habit because this will trip you up eventually! 

### Comments & Debugging

First let's start with a few things that are mainly built for us humans.

Comments help us add annotations to our code (you'll see these used in examples below).

```js
// a single-line comment

/*
a multi-
line comment
*/
```

The JavaScript console makes it easy to check what's going on with our code by printing it out. It's sort of like a stethoscope for our code.

```js
console.log("Do as I say, JavaSCript");
console.log("(this is mainly to help us humans)");
```

### Variables

We use these to store information -- they're one of the basic building blocks of code. Think of variables as buckets we can fill with whatever we like. We use the `var` keyword to create a variable. 

```js
// this "declares" a variable, makes our bucket
var bucket;

// this "assigns" our bucket, or fills it with something
bucket = "fun";

// we can dump it out & fill it with something else
bucket = "sun";

// we can also do this all in one step 
var barrel = "monkeys";

// now this wil print out "monkeys"
console.log(barrel);
```

There are specific rules about how variables are named. Here are some examples valid names:

```js
var lowercase;
var camelCase;
var under_scores_are_fine;
var numbersAreMostlyOk99;
```

These are no good:

```js
// ERROR
var no spaces;
// BANG!
var no-dashes-or-punctiation!;
// KABOOM!
var 7noStartingWithNumbers;
```

Variables have a **data type**, basically what kind of data it contains. Here are a few:

**Numbers** are pretty obvious:

```js
// a number can have a decimal just be a whole number
var bottlesOfBeer = 99;
var glass = 0.5;
```

**Strings** are text surrounded by quotes. They are a _string_ of letters, which are called "characters" in computer-speak:

```js
// you can use single or double qutes
var firstName = 'John';
var lastName = "Doe";

// you can use "+" to connect strings together
// this will print "John Doe"
console.log(firstName+" "+lastName);
```

**Arrays** are less intuitive, they're a collection of other variables that have a specific order. Think of an array as a bookshelf, where each book is in a specific order.

```js
// create an array with 3 strings
/// divided by commas, in square brackets
var books = ["The Great Gatsby", "Cloud Atlas", "Ulysses"];

// we can add another string at the end
books.push("The Design of Everyday Things");
```

We can access array items based on their number (or "index" in computer-speak):


```js
// IMPORTANT: array numbering starts at 0!
// this will print "The Great Gatsby"
console.log(books[0]);

// this will print "The Design of Everyday Thinks"
console.log(books[3]);

```

There are many other data types, but we'll save those for later.


### Functions

Functions are basically little code-machines. You set them up to do a specific task and they make life easier for you. 

```js

// this defines the function
function remindMe() {
  console.log("Don't forget to bring a towel!");
}

// will print "Don't forget to bring a towel"
remindMe();
```

A function can have what are called arguments, which are variables that you send into the function.

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hi, "+name+"!");
}

// will print out "Howdy, Al!"
greet("All");

// this prints out "Howdy, Pardner!"
greet("Pardner!");

```

There are a lot of functions that already exist that you'll find yourself using. For instance, `console.log` is a special function that will print out whatever you feed it to the console!

## Document object model

The Document Object Model is the system that allows JavaScript to connect to a web page.

### Page elements

```js
var body = document.querySelector("body");
```

```js
var paras = document.querySelectorAll("p");
```


### Modifying page elemnts


### Creating page elements

```js
var header = document.createElement('h1');
header.innerHTML = "Hey there!";
document.body.appendChild(header);
```


* query selector
* query selector all
* creating elements
* parents / children
* attributes

## Basic interaction

```js
alert("Yo!");
```

```js
confirm("Are you sure?");
```

```js
document.body.onclick = function() {
  alert("Can't touch this!");
}
```

## jQuery?

What is jQuery? It's a few things.

1. A "wrapper" to make certain js functions (like `querySelector`) easier to use and more compatible for multiple browsers
2. A swiss-army knife that adds functionality to js
3. A plugin system that makes it easier to add functionality to your page.

```js
var body = document.querySelector('body');
var message = document.createElement('div');

message.class = 'greeting';
message.innerHTML = "Hello there!";

message.onclick = function() {
  alert("How are you?");
}

body.appendChild(message);

```

```js
// this will do the same thing!
// but it looks like jibberish at first
$('<div class="greeting"></div>')
  .on('click', function() { alert("How are you?")})
  .appendTo($('body'));
```
